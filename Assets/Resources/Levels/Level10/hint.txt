Remember the level 5? Someone tried to complete it, but mixed everything up.
The line should go from the bottom to the top, not the other way.
Here is a little tip - split your task into three parts: 
1. Move all bots to the bottom of the board, picking up the pieces along. 
2. Place pieces crosswise. 
3. Make your way to the top of the board.
